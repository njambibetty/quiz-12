    She goes unnoticed she knows no limits she craves attention she praises an image she prays to be sculpted by the sculptor.She don't see the light that's shining deeper than the eyes can find it maybe we are made of blind so she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away because cover girls don't cry after their face is made.She has dreams to be an evny,so she's starving you know, covergirls at nothing she says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything what's a little bit of hunger I can go a while longer, she fades away.She don't see her perfect she don't understand she's worth it or that beauty goes deeper than the surface.There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark.You should know you are beautiful just the way the you are, you don't have to change a thing the world could change it's heart.No scars, we are stars.
